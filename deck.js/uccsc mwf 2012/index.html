    <h1>An Update On MWF Collaborative Efforts</h1>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>UCSF Mobile Initial Launch</h2>

  </figure>
  <div class="deck-notes">
    In 2010, we launched UCSF Mobile. It was kind of a lark. No one was doing a mobile site for UCSF so we just went and did it. It was far more successful than we expected and we decided to get ambitious. We wanted  perhaps to bite off more than we could chew. The MWF project had some nice features we didn't and other UCs were adopting it, so it seemed like a no-brainer for us to join in.
  </div>

  <h2>UCSF Mobile 2.0</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src=images/ucsfmobile2.0.png alt="">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">January 2012</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div class="deck-notes">
    Our site looked much better and we got to contribute lots of stuff that helped others: tests, features such as a customizable home screen, bug fixes, and so on. We were very active and it was a lot of fun. Our particular need, though, was for performance, and for performance in ways that perhaps other schools didn't need it. You see, our web site was also our interface for our native iPhone, iPad, and Android apps. You can't have a "click the button, and wait for 3 and a half seconds before you see content" experience.
  </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Focus on performance</h2>
  <ul><li class="slide">MWF appcache handler<li class="slide">Lightning Touch (<a href=http://trott.github.com/LightningTouch>http://trott.github.com/LightningTouch</a>)
  </ul>
  <figure class="slide">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">Faster still!</figcaption>
    <img src=images/allthethings.png alt="">
  </figure>
  <div class="deck-notes">
    So, we really targeted performance. ... We contributed code for an appcache handler to MWF so that sites could run offline and load faster when they were online. ...  We released a library called Lightning Touch that I encourage you to check out. It makes the touch interface faster.  These helped a lot ...  but we wanted to take it further. We want the fastest site possible.  By the way, these changes not only make the native app feel like, well, a native app, but they also greatly improve the user experience in the browser. I think this is awesome, because why should web users be treated like second class citizens? 
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>MWF's Device Telemetry Stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="slide">Makes telemetry information available on the server.
      <li class="slide">Support for distributed sites (content is on one server and MWF is on another server) means redirects.
    </ul>
      <figure class="slide">
        <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">Redirects are bad for performance.</figcaption>
        <img src=images/hindenbug.jpg alt="">
      </figure>
    <div class="deck-notes">
      We took some measurements and determined that performance took its biggest hit on initial page load from the Device Telemetry Stack or DTS. ... DTS makes information like screen size available on the server. ... The DTS implementation uses a pair of redirects on initial load. ... Redirects hurt your page load speed. On mobile, the delay can be measured in seconds.
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>DTS is deeply embedded in MWF</h2>
  <h3 class="slide">Can we really remove it?</h3>

  <figure class="slide">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">YES!</figcaption>
    <img src=images/brohoof.jpeg alt="">
  </figure>
  <div class="deck-notes">
    Because DTS is so deeply embedded in MWF, the question that came up was: ... Are we biting off more than we can chew? Can we really remove it? ... The answer turned out to be: Yes, we can! There are a lot of features in DTS, but the truth is that we just weren't using most of them. And the ones that we were using, we could accomplish the same thing in other ways.
  </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Site speed FTW!</h2>
  <figure class="slide">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">And the code base is greatly slimmed to boot!</figcaption>
    <img src=images/jared.jpeg alt="">
  </figure>
  <div class="deck-notes">
    The site is now plenty fast. ... And a nice side benefit is that this resulted in a much more svelte code base. Now, basically, once we had removed DTS, we in effect weren't really running MWF anymore. In an unhealthy collaborative environment, this would be the end of the collaboration. But we stayed involved, kept talking to everyone, and our interests along with UCSD's different interests eventually gelled with UCLA's plans and poof!
  </div>
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>MWF 2.0</h2>
  <figure class="slide">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">Responsive &amp; DTS-free</figcaption>
    <img src=images/success.png alt="">
  </figure>
  <div class="deck-notes">
     MWF 2.0 ... will be device telemetry stack-free. It will also have responsive web design features.

    <h2>Collaboration is overrated</h2>
    
    <figure>
      <img src=images/collaboration.jpg alt="There's a funny picture here. You're missing it.">
      <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:smaller">Image source: 
        <a href="http://www.despair.com/meetings.html">http://www.despair.com/meetings.html</a>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3 class="slide"><em>Ha, ha! Just kidding!</em></h3>
    <div class="deck-notes">
      The moral of the story, of course, is that collaboration is totally overrated. ... No, just kidding.
    </div>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src=images/chewit.jpeg alt="">
    </figure>
    <div class="deck-notes">
      We would have never gotten as far as we did without MWF as a jumping-off point. We would not have had as many things to experiment with and would not have had as many people to bounce ideas off. Both the spirit of collaboration and, yes, healthy competition enabled us to bite off more than we could chew, and then proceed to chew it.
