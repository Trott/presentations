  <h2>UCSF Library Drupal Launch</h2>

  <div class="deck-notes">
    The UCSF Library launched our Drupal web site in 2009. At the time, we were among the first on campus to use Drupal. Our goals were simple and modest: Build an awesome web site and ... be to Drupal what Samuel L. Jackson is to swearing.  We succeeded on the first count&mdash;the site was awesome. On the second count, well, no one does anything the way Samuel L. Jackson does swearing.

  <h2>Central IT is launching a Drupal service!</h2>
  <figure class="slide">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">Oh noes!!!1!</figcaption>

  <div class="deck-notes">
    We upgraded to Drupal 6 in 2011 and kept plugging away on new features that library people like such as integrating LibGuides into our site search. Then we heard that central IT was going to run a central Drupal service. ... We were wary. "They're going to take over our site and make it suck! All our awesome features are going to break or go away!"

  <h2>What? All-carrot approach?</h2>
  <figure class="slide">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:larger">Hooray!</figcaption>

  <div class="deck-notes">
    Most people who have spent time working for library IT in an American university can probably tell you that there is usually some friction between library IT and campus IT. They probably have a plausible theory about why that is as well. Regardless, campus IT did something here that was simple and frankly brilliant. They probably could have gotten a mandate that sites like ours had to use their service. But they didn't. ... Rather than trying to compel us to use their service, IT tried to make a service that was so terrific that we'd have to be completely stupid not to use.

    <h2>IT + Library = BFF</h2>
    <img src=images/bff.png>
    <div class="deck-notes">
      This had a number of positive effects For one thing, it made everyone a lot more open to each other's ideas. They didn't want us to use their service whether we liked it or not; they wanted us to like what they were doing. So, we worked with IT to implement Shibboleth integration, for example. And we weren't threatened by the possibility that they might succeed.  We're in hybrid mode right now, using the IT solution for some sites and running others ourselves. This is nothing short of a miracle. And so far, it's been great. We expect to move more sites soon.
